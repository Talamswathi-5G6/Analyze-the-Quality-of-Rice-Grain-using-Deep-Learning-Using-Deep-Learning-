# Analyze-the-Quality-of-Rice-Grain-using-Deep-Learning-Using-Deep-Learning-
This project uses deep learning to analyze rice grain quality based on size, shape, color, and texture. It includes image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using CNN models. The goal is to provide fast, accurate, and consistent quality assessment with potential for real-time use.
